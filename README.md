 Hi, Iâ€™m Alex, a third year undergraduate student at the University of Washington, majoring in Mathematics. 
 I have a minor in Applied Mathematics. I am currently exploring my interests, but I have really liked Functional Analysis, Optimization, and Graph Theory so far. If you'd like to know a little bit more about my interests, check out my academic page: https://alexalbors7.github.io.
